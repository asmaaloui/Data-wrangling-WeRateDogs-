Data Wrangling (WeRateDogs)
Context
WeRateDogs is a twitter account which share dog images and write a brief panegyric about the dog, then they let their followers to rate it by favoriting it. By asking WeRateDogs to share with us some of their tweets, they did. They have shared 5000+ of their tweets which contains some basic data. Sometimes in their brief panegyric they mention the breed of the dog, and some others they donâ€™t. But thanks to Udacity, they have performed some neutral network procedures to classify the dogs based on their images which are shared with the tweets.

Data Wrangling
The objective of this project is to gather data from different sources, to be assessed and then to perform cleansing techniques to raise the quality and tidiness of the data. Hence, it can be used in any later analysis.

Data Gathering
Let us first start by gathering the two data sources "Twitter Basic Details" as twitter_archive_enhanced.csv and "Dogs Image Classification" as image_predictions.tsv.
